# Smooth Camera Switcher Component for Unity

As the name implies the asset helps you do a smooth camera switch between multiple cameras in Unity.

The asset only works in perspective mode. Smoothing is applied for position, rotation, and FOV. 

This asset's purpose is to show what the idea behind a smooth camera switch is and how it can be applied in different situations. I cannot say that it is polished or written in a clean fashion.
